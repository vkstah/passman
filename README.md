# Vault

Vault is a lightweight and ultra-simple password manager built with Python for my personal use.

## Features

Vault allows you to create a centralized and locally hosted vault for all your passwords that can be accessed using a master password. In addition to the master password, a secret key (sometimes called device secret) is also required, to add an additional layer of security.

- Add, edit or remove credentials (username, password)
- Copy credentials to clipboard without ever displaying them on the terminal
- Automatic script timeout after X amount of seconds for additional security
- Stores AES encrypted credentials into a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
